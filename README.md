# MyMicroscoPi
This design combines many of my hobbies; Lego, electronics, 3D printing, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.

It is a remix of this well documented [design of Yuksel Temizon](https://www.hackster.io/news/ibm-researcher-makes-a-microscope-using-lego-arduino-and-raspberry-pi-cbc58cb69a20?utm_source=Hackster+Marketing&utm_campaign=7e2e7b20ec-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_14_02_53_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_86d76c4d75-7e2e7b20ec-144680307&mc_cid=7e2e7b20ec&mc_eid=ea3c09e980)
My version of this DIY microscope uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with 8MP camera and modified lens for the image, while 2 Arduino Pro mini's control the stepper motors and LED lighting.

My version of this DIY microscope is also built of Lego bricks. It uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with an 8MP camera and modified lens to capture images and videos. The 6 Stepper motors and the high-power LED illumination are controlled bij two Arduino Pro mini's using a circuit board comprising an Arduino microcontroller, six stepper motor drivers and a high-power LED driver. All functions can be controlled from a keyboard connected to the Raspberry Pi or a separate custom-built Arduino joystick connected to the mainboard. LEGO bricks are used to construct the main body of the microscope to achieve a modular and easy-to-assemble design concept.
