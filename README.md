# MyMicroscoPi
This microscope design combines many of my hobbies; Lego, electronics, 3D printing, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.

It is a remix of a great and well documented [design of Yuksel Temizon](https://www.hackster.io/news/ibm-researcher-makes-a-microscope-using-lego-arduino-and-raspberry-pi-cbc58cb69a20?utm_source=Hackster+Marketing&utm_campaign=7e2e7b20ec-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_14_02_53_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_86d76c4d75-7e2e7b20ec-144680307&mc_cid=7e2e7b20ec&mc_eid=ea3c09e980).
My version of this DIY microscope uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with 8MP camera and modified lens for the image, while 2 Arduino Pro mini's control the stepper motors and LED lighting.

My version of this DIY microscope is also built of Lego bricks. It uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with an 8MP camera and modified lens to capture images and videos. The six stepper motors and the high-power LED are controlled by two PCB's with an Arduino Pro mini on each board.
One PCB (the mainboard) contains all the driver hardware for the steppers and Power LED, the other PBC (the Controller board) contains all the control elements such as:
- Three joysticks to control the X, Y, Rotary, Tilt, Magnitude and Focus 
- A Rotary encoder to control the Power LED and a small OLED display to indicate the brightness of the LED

I used the 3D printed LEGO gears and adapters of original design of Yuksel Temizon

So now I'm going to do some nice experiments
