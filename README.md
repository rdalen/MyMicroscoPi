# MyMicroscoPi
This DIY microscope design combines many of my hobbies; Lego, electronics, 3D printing, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.

It is a remix of a great and well documented [design of Yuksel Temizon](https://www.hackster.io/news/ibm-researcher-makes-a-microscope-using-lego-arduino-and-raspberry-pi-cbc58cb69a20?utm_source=Hackster+Marketing&utm_campaign=7e2e7b20ec-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_14_02_53_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_86d76c4d75-7e2e7b20ec-144680307&mc_cid=7e2e7b20ec&mc_eid=ea3c09e980).

My version of this microscope is also built of LEGO bricks. I use LEGO Technic baems because they are light and strong.
For capturing images it uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with an 8MP camera and modified lens. The six stepper motors for the camera & sample movements and the Power LED for illunination are controlled by two PCB's with an Arduino Pro mini on each board.
One PCB (Mainboard) contains all the driver hardware for the steppers and Power LED, the other PCB (Controller board) contains the human interface elements for controlling the microscope. Such ase; Three joysticks to control the X, Y, Rotary, Tilt (Camera-angle), Magnitude and Focus, a Rotary encoder to control the Power LED and a small OLED display to indicate the brightness of the LED

I used the 3D printed LEGO gears and adapters of original design of Yuksel Temizon

So now I'm going to do some nice experiments!
